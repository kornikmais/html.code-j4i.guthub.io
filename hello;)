Hello, Lorence. Kuya rather. I hope this message finds you very well;). I've been keeping this as a secret for a very long time. The first time I saw you, my heart fluttered again after months of emptiness( oa na sa oa ). As the school year comes to an end, I want to confess the feelings I've kept for so long.

I've been thinking about confessing my feelings for you for how many days and now I have the courage to tell you. I like you. No jokes, I am not infatuated or else. Others may adore you becuase of your appearance and talents, but my admiration for you grows beyond skin deep and all those achievements, I like you for who you are and everything that comes within you to the point I just wish, you could see yourself the way I view you. We may not know each other but that won't stop me from liking you.  I know you may not feel the same way, but I still wanted to express how I feel.

No matter what, I will continue to admire you from afar, like a fan from the crowd. Thank you, and goodnight. God bless;)

- Don't tell anyone about this, please? Kahit sa close friends or friends mo. Baka hindi na 'ko papasok ng school niyan, joke. Thank you! Nakakakaba naman mag message sa'yo;/ But at least I've already told you how I feel;)
